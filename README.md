## ⚽ football transfer project ⚽

I developed this project after gaining interest in the football transfer market system while watching matches. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and I added additional features to enhance the analysis for learning and improvement purposes

### 💻 Dataset Information

- `football_market_sample.csv` : Player market and transfer data  

- `player_injury_sample.csv` : Player injury history data  

- `career_sample.csv` : Player career achievements data

<br/>

### 📊 Visualization

- Visualized the distribution of numerical features using histograms
  
- Performed basic data inspection (NaN values, duplicates, statistics)

<br/>

### 🔧 Data Preprocessing

- Extracted contract dates, handled missing values, and engineered features from career and injury data  

- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables for consistency across train/test sets  

- Implemented modeling with XGBoost and LightGBM
